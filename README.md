#SerLCD_cI2C
===========================================================
This is a derivative of the Sparkfun library for controlling an LCD screen. The original library uses the in-built Wire library in Arduino distributions for I2C communication. Unfortunately, the Wire library has been known to block indefinitely in rare circumstances, which is undesirable for equipment that will be operating for a long time. This library utilizes a custom non-blocking I2C library to solve that problem.
